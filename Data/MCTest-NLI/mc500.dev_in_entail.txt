entailment	One sunny morning, Stewart chose to go to the beach. He knew that a rainstorm was going to arrive on Saturday and wanted to enjoy some sun before it arrived.   Stewart laid on his belly and began reading his newspaper. As he was enjoying the sun and the newspaper, he saw a bug crawl across his blanket. At first Stewart thought it was an ant, but the bug was moving too slowly to be an ant. As Stewart leaned in for a closer look, the bug cried out, "Excuse me, sir! Can you help me?" Stewart was surprised and jumped to his feet. "You can talk!" he shouted. "Yes," said the bug. "Please help me! As you might know, there is a rainstorm coming into town. Unfortunately, I do not have a place to call home. I need to find somewhere to sleep before the rain washes me away!" Stewart felt sad. "Gee," he cried. "That sounds terrible!"  Stewart thought about the problem. "Perhaps you can stay at my house," he said. The bug jumped for joy and said, "Oh, that would be wonderful!" The two traveled back to Stewart's house and the bug found a soft spot to sleep.  The next day, the sky had darkened and rain clouds appeared all over town. Just as the news had said, a rainstorm had arrived. When Stewart woke up, he looked for the bug but could not find him. Then, he saw something flying around his house. "Thank you for letting me sleep here last night," said the butterfly. It was the bug! "I knew I could not change into a butterfly if I was out in the rain. I won't forget your kindness." After speaking, the butterfly flew away. Stewart stood in his doorway and shouted, "Goodbye!"	If the rain arrived on Saturday, Friday day did Stewart go to the beach.

non_entailment	My mommy has a really cool job! She makes costumes for movie stars. She works in the attic of our house, so I get to see her work all the time. I watch every movie I can, and try to learn all of the different costumes by heart. Mommy says if I work hard and keep up my practice, one day I'll get to to make costumes for movie stars too! That job sounds like heaven.  One day I was in the attic, helping Mommy make a boot for a costume.  They were covered in little beads, and mom had to sew them on. She kept dropping the needles on the ground. Then I was helping by picking them up. I was also helping by moving the lamp around so Mommy could see the boot better.   "Ouch!" I said. "I accidentally stuck my finger with the needle!"  My mommy looked at my finger, and gave it a kiss.  "Welcome to the life of a costumer!"	Mommy doesdo as a job filming movies.

entailment	It was a cold day when John made up his mind to go outside and check the fence.  There had been things missing from the back yard, and he was starting to think there was a criminal at work.

non_entailment	I am going to get a hamster in a few weeks, or maybe a month! I have been waiting for a hamster for years, so I don't want to wait another day! She's going to have a big home with lots of paper towel rolls to eat, or even sleep in. My little hamster is going to bite me in the beginning, as hamsters are nervous, but we're going to end up being best friends. She's going to sit on my shoulder as I do the dishes or do my homework. When I'm reading my favorite book, sleeping, or when I'm showering, my hamster needs to go back to her home. I think that she is going to pee without warning and at the worst times, I am going to scratch her little belly and love her all the more when she pushes carrots into her mouth. I am sure that my little hamster is going to get into a lot more trouble, too. Maybe she'll be scared of thunder and try to run away. Or maybe she'll be so curious about going outside to the street that she might get hurt.  I do not care about the amount of trouble that my little hamster gets into I'll always make sure she has water to drink, food to eat, and love from my heart.	am I going to get a hamster on Today.

I do not care about the amount of trouble that my little hamster gets into I'll always make sure she has water to drink, food to eat, and love from my heart.	Bite me, pee on me, run away, try to go outside'll my hamster do that is bad.
non_entailment	I am going to get a hamster in a few weeks, or maybe a month! I have been waiting for a hamster for years, so I don't want to wait another day! She's going to have a big home with lots of paper towel rolls to eat, or even sleep in. My little hamster is going to bite me in the beginning, as hamsters are nervous, but we're going to end up being best friends. She's going to sit on my shoulder as I do the dishes or do my homework. When I'm reading my favorite book, sleeping, or when I'm showering, my hamster needs to go back to her home. I think that she is going to pee without warning and at the worst times, I am going to scratch her little belly and love her all the more when she pushes carrots into her mouth.

non_entailment	Thunder can move a seesaw. This is very important to know if you ever see what I saw. One day, I was walking home when I saw a squirrel on a seesaw near my house. It was running up and down, and all around, playing by itself. Suddenly, an ox appeared from nowhere. It came up to the squirrel, walked around the seesaw for a bit, then sat down on one end. As you know, an ox is a very big animal, so the seesaw threw the squirrel off and high into the air! The squirrel flew so high that it passed the buildings. It passed the birds, it passed the planes and stopped in the clouds. When it was there, it made friends with the clouds and asked one of the clouds a secret question. The cloud said okay, and sent the squirrel back to the ground. The squirrel fell and fell for a long time. Finally he landed on the seesaw, but the ox didn't move. "Where were you?" the ox asked, "Just talking with a friend," answered the mouse. I was watching and listening to everything, so I stayed, waiting. Soon enough, a loud CLAP of thunder came from the clouds and threw the ox off of the seesaw and far, far away. So, you see, thunder can move a seesaw.	the second thing the squirrel was passed the buildings.

It seemed strange to him, but not as strange as it was to see Linda the brown chicken in the living room last spring. That still confused him.   He thought he liked this dog, not because of the color, but because it was small. And it was so hairy. It was a like a mop that could run around. He jumped on his favorite chair and looked down as Maggie ran under it. She was kind of cute for a dog, Pester thought to himself. He layed down on the chair and pawed at her as she ran in a circle under it. He tapped her ears as she went by, and waved his tail like a flag trying to get her attention. After a little more of this, Pester curled up in a ball on the chair and took a nap.	the dog's was name Maggie.

After he had eaten his food, it was afternoon. The sun was setting, and Jimmy wanted to rest in the sun, and sleep. He found a nice place to sit, and began to rest. Falling asleep quickly, he slept for a few hours. When he woke up it was dark outside. He had missed dinnertime, but there were always those worms at the bottom of the pond. Jimmy ate quickly, and was soon ready to swim more. The pond was small, not a lake, or a river or a stream. He swam around for a little longer, and soon it was ready for bed in the nest, where he slept with his family Billy, Susie, and Doug. The other animals were sleeping as well, the dog and the cat on the porch. The cow was sleeping in the barn. And last the kittens in their box. Jimmy was ready for bed, it had been a long day, and the next day was going to be the same. But Jimmy did not care. He loved being a duck. Jimmy was one happy duck.	name of the duck was Billy.

non_entailment	There once was a guy named Kevin and girl named Erin.  They really liked spending time together.  One day, Kevin traveled from his home in the United States of America to Erin's house in England.  They then thought to take a sudden trip around the world.  They first traveled by plane around Europe, where they saw many different people and sights.  They then took a boat to Africa and Asia, where they went on a trip through the mountains.  Later in the month, they traveled to China by train and were allowed to see how different life was over there.  Next they took another plane to Australia, where they had a lot of fun seeing kangaroos and a different type of English speaking people.  After spending a week in Australia, Kevin and Erin took a really long plane ride to North America, where they drove across the land.  They saw everything from the mountains to forests.  They even got to visit the beach!  Because they had so much fun, Kevin returned home with Erin to England where they hung out and spent the next few days and months talking about all of the neat things they saw and did on their trip.

They first traveled by plane around Europe, where they saw many different people and sights.  They then took a boat to Africa and Asia, where they went on a trip through the mountains.  Later in the month, they traveled to China by train and were allowed to see how different life was over there.  Next they took another plane to Australia, where they had a lot of fun seeing kangaroos and a different type of English speaking people.  After spending a week in Australia, Kevin and Erin took a really long plane ride to North America, where they drove across the land.  They saw everything from the mountains to forests.  They even got to visit the beach!  Because they had so much fun, Kevin returned home with Erin to England where they hung out and spent the next few days and months talking about all of the neat things they saw and did on their trip.	Kevin and Erin NOT took to travel Train.

The pink moon was shining with the power and light of the sun! All the lizards, cacti and every animal stood still in awe of the daytime pink moon! But at that time, the sun slipped away, saying "Farewell, pink moon. We have to do this again!" And so, every few years, the sun and moon come together to show the pink moon's is always with us, even in the day time .	it took hours the moon to reach the sun.
non_entailment	One day, a pink moon was looking down at an empty sand land. Although the pink moon could see all the lizards and cacti in the empty sand land, nobody could see the moon! The pink moon felt so lonely. So, the pink moon called on the sun for help. The great sun was very busy high in the sky, for it was his job to shine over the sand land, and it was hard to get his attention. So the moon wiggled closer and closer to the sun every second. The second turned to hours as the pink moon inched toward his friend, slowly moving across the sky. Finally, the sun saw the moon and asked, "Pink moon! What are you doing here? Don't you know the sky is my home during the day? Your time is coming soon enough. Look, I'm falling now toward my bed on the end of the earth..." But the pink moon could not be stopped and kept moving toward the great sun. "But great sun, I become so lonely during the day when your light is so bright the animals in the sand land can't see me. Please let me join your light during the day this once!" By this time, the great sun and pink moon were only inches apart. The great sun said, "Though by day you disappear, I always remember you are here. Come to me now. Stand in front of me, and show the sand land your shine!" So the pink moon inched in front of the great sun. At first, covering part of the sun's circle, then more, then...a complete covering of the sun!

Mike and Sally played lots of games at the park. After a long time, Mike saw it was starting to get dark. He needed to hurry if he was going to make it to the store and get home before night time. Mike rode as fast as he could, and made it to the store. The store was really big, but Mike found the sugar really fast. When Mike was on his way to the front of the store to pay for the sugar, he saw a toy he had been wanting for a long time. But Mike only had enough money to pay for the sugar or the toy. Mike didn't know what to do! The cake would taste good and would make his mom happy. But, the toy was so cool! Mike bought the sugar for his mom's cake, because she was always so nice to him. He could always get the toy another time.    2. What did Mike find at the store that he wanted to buy	Mike almost bought instead of the sugar Flowers for his Mom.

non_entailment	One morning, I woke up and went downstairs for breakfast. I fixed my normal breakfast: hot pickles, marshmallows, and ketchup. First I heat up the pickles on the stove, then I put the marshmallows in the toaster as I pour out my small plate of ketchup. Delicious! I eat it every morning, often with a tall glass of lemonade.  I sat down at the table to eat, and looked out the window at the birds in my yard. Sometimes I see skunks outside, and once I saw a small pot-bellied pig. But today there were only a few flamingos. I opened up the book I was reading, "All About Birds." I had finished the chapter on pigeons, and was moving on to robins.  While putting ketchup on my marshmallows, I felt something tickling my neck. I looked down, and there was a daddy long-legs, climbing up! I had never seen one so close to my face.   "Er, what's up?" I asked.   "Not much," he said. "I smelled the hot pickles, and wanted to have a taste."  "Sure, little guy," I said. I put a small piece of pickle on my finger and held it out. While I was doing that, that sneaky daddy-long-legs ran down my arm. He grabbed the rest of my pickle, and ran out the door! And that was the last time I gave a pickle to a spider at breakfast.

I asked.   "Not much," he said. "I smelled the hot pickles, and wanted to have a taste."  "Sure, little guy," I said. I put a small piece of pickle on my finger and held it out. While I was doing that, that sneaky daddy-long-legs ran down my arm. He grabbed the rest of my pickle, and ran out the door!

His mom sat on a bench not too far away, reading a book. "Should I tell Mom?" Sammy thought to himself. He thought that maybe he shouldn't, because he might get in trouble. Instead, he was going to climb the fence into Mr. Grumpy's yard! "What, are you crazy?" Sammy's friend Billy said when he told him what he was going to do. Billy didn't seem to like the idea. "Mr. Grumpy is a mean old man, and he'll yell at you for sure. I think you need to tell your mom!" With that, Billy ran off to tell Sammy's mom! Sammy ran after Billy, trying to get him to stop, but Billy told the whole story before Sammy could get there. After Sammy's mom heard the story, she took Sammy by the hand and said, "Come on, Sammy, let's go get your shoe!" Sammy was worried. What was she going to do? Sammy's mom took him straight to mean old Mr. Grumpy's door, and knocked on it. "Oh no!" thought Sammy, "He's going to yell at me!" But the man who opened the door was a nice old man, and he smiled at little Sammy, and let them get his shoe. That's when Sammy learned that it's always better to be honest.	A Fence flew into Mr. Grumpy's yard.

It is hard to believe last month there was snow on the ground." The boys jogged to the playing field and shook hands with the other boys. "This is going to be a great game, the first of the summer." one of the boys said. The game started and everyone had a turn. Paul's team was behind by two points. Terry took his place at the plate. "Batter up!" The pitcher threw the first ball. "STRIKE ONE!" Then the second and crack, the bat hit the ball and it flew through the air. Terry ran to the first base. Next, John hit the ball with the first throw and he ran to first base and Terry stole third base. The third player was Joey, a red headed boy. He was not a very good player and he missed the ball three times. "OUT." He was followed by George and he also made an out. Up came Tiny. He hit the ball and made it to first base, John moved to second and Terry stayed on third. CRACK! HOME RUN! Paul ran around the bases and Terry, John, and Tiny all made it in. Paul saved the game and the day! Paul's team won the first game of the summer!	Paul was first up to hit the ball.

He got out of the shower and pulled on his clothes. He looked at the calendar on his desk and smiled knowing yesterday, Friday, had been the last day of school. "Hi, Mom!

Diamond took a string out of its pocket.  Diamond tied it to her, and then she tied it to a tree.  "Watch this!"  Diamond jumped into the wind.  Suddenly, she was flying!  She floated.  She swooped.  She played with the clouds and the birds.  She flew faster.  She flew slower.  At first, Square was amazed.  But slowly, Square started to frown.  Diamond landed in front of her friend.  "What's wrong?"  "That was amazing!  It looks like a lot of fun.  But I am not shaped like a kite.  I can't do those amazing things like you."  Diamond smiled.  "Yes you can, Square!  Stand on your tip-toes!"  So Square did.  "Now, go look at yourself in the river."  Square walked to the river and looked down.  But he did not see a square.  He saw a diamond!  Diamond handed Square the string.  "Now jump!" she said.  Square jumped.  He jumped as high as he could.  Just as he started to fall, the wind blew and picked him up.  He was flying, like Diamond!

non_entailment	The sun was rising in the morning and the birds were waking up. A mother bird was watching over her baby eggs in the nest. She laid four eggs yesterday, some white and some spotted. She had been keeping them warm so that her babies would soon be born. Little cracks appeared on the eggs and they started to grow and grow. Little "cheeping" sounds could be heard coming from inside, and soon the eggs cracked open. Featherless baby birds were inside, crying for food. The mother had nothing to give, so she quickly flew to the ground and looked in the dirt for food. She saw some worms wiggling in the ground. She picked a few up with her beak and flew them up to the nest. The babies were well fed with the worms, and the mother kept them all warm in the cold spring morning. Mr. Bird came home to find his new babies, and they were all a happy family.	All spotted color are the eggs.

non_entailment	Once upon a time I had a dog named Toodles. He was black and white and had long floppy ears. He also had very short legs, but really big paws. Every Saturday we would go to the park and play Toodles' favorite game. Toodles loved playing fetch. One Saturday, Toodles ran over to the pond because he saw ducks swimming there. He ran all around the pond, barking at the ducks. The ducks ignored him, and kept swimming. Toodles wasn't having it! He jumped into the pond and started swimming toward the ducks, chasing around his new playmates. One of the ducks, braver than the others, poked Toodles with his beak - and then bit him right on one of his floppy ears! Toodles barked and ran out of the pond because the duck hurt his ear. Soaking wet, he ran toward where I was eating a sandwich on the grass and curled right up in my lap so I could make him feel better.

non_entailment	"I don't think I can win the race" Tim told his parents over breakfast. His mother asked "Why not?" but his father was silent. Tim knew his father didn't believe he could be a racer: only last year, he had sent Tim to a doctor to ask why his son wasn't a better runner. The doctor told him Tim could be anything he wanted to be, and maybe he didn't like to run.   Tim, who had always preferred a good book to P.E. class, wanted to show his family that he really could be what they wanted him to be, so he spent his allowance on a pair of green running shoes and signed up for his school's Spring Fun Run.   Tim answered, "I'm going to try to win, but Angela is so quick! No one ever beats her at recess."   "Well, we'll be there for you, either way" his mother said.  Tim took an apple and walked to the bus. Since the race was after school today (school was letting out at 3:00 today, instead of 3:15), he knew he would be too nervous to think about anything else until it began. He didn't even bring his new book with him, an action book starring an orphan named Simon that Tim sometimes pretended to be.  3:30 arrived and the race was about to begin. All the other students had brought running shorts, but Tim was going to have to run in his school pants. Suddenly, he saw that his shoes were untied. As he bent down to tie them, one of the older boys kicked the back of his knee, making him fall down right as the race began. By the time he got up and tied his shoes, he saw he would finish in last place, as the other kids were much farther ahead of him.   It was almost 4:00 before Tim saw the end of the run. By the time Tim reached the finish line, the group of parents waiting on their kids was very small, as some kids had been finished for a long time. Tim's father asked, "What took you so long? I'm surprised to see you here at all! Why did you sign up for this when we all knew you wouldn't win?"   Tim thought about why he signed up. It wasn't about winning the race, or making his father proud. It was about finishing, and showing himself that the doctor was right: he could be anything he wanted to be, like his favorite character, Simon.

Since the race was after school today (school was letting out at 3:00 today, instead of 3:15), he knew he would be too nervous to think about anything else until it began. He didn't even bring his new book with him, an action book starring an orphan named Simon that Tim sometimes pretended to be.  3:30 arrived and the race was about to begin. All the other students had brought running shorts, but Tim was going to have to run in his school pants. Suddenly, he saw that his shoes were untied. As he bent down to tie them, one of the older boys kicked the back of his knee, making him fall down right as the race began. By the time he got up and tied his shoes, he saw he would finish in last place, as the other kids were much farther ahead of him.   It was almost 4:00 before Tim saw the end of the run. By the time Tim reached the finish line, the group of parents waiting on their kids was very small, as some kids had been finished for a long time. Tim's father asked, "What took you so long? I'm surprised to see you here at all! Why did you sign up for this when we all knew you wouldn't win?"   Tim thought about why he signed up. It wasn't about winning the race, or making his father proud. It was about finishing, and showing himself that the doctor was right: he could be anything he wanted to be, like his favorite character, Simon.	3:30 timedoes the race start.

The doctor told him Tim could be anything he wanted to be, and maybe he didn't like to run.   Tim, who had always preferred a good book to P.E. class, wanted to show his family that he really could be what they wanted him to be, so he spent his allowance on a pair of green running shoes and signed up for his school's Spring Fun Run.

non_entailment	Bill and Sarah chose to meet at the park on Saturday to play ball and have a picnic. They went to the same grade school together and lived on the same street down from the park. Sarah does not often like boys, but for a boy, Bill was alright. Most boys like Tom and Mark are stupid and a real pain, but Bill was a lot of fun to play with and didn't do dumb things like putting a booger on her back during recess. When Bill and Sarah arrived at the park, they first played ball in the grass near the playground. Then they chose to pretend that Bill was a monster and Sarah was the monster hunter. Sarah chased Bill all over the playground. They went in and out and up and down. Bill ran under the slide and stepped in a puddle. He didn't get hurt but he sure got plenty wet. Playing the monster game was the most fun that they had at the park that day. Later they sat in the grass for a picnic. They both took off their shoes so that Bill's feet could dry off and so that he wouldn't feel silly without shoes. Sarah took out her lunch and laid it out next to her. She had dried fruit and cheese and a peanut butter sandwich. Bill opened his lunch bag and found a coke, a bag of chips, and a ham salad sandwich. Sarah wanted to trade Bill his bag of chips for her fruit. He said that would be a fair trade and they enjoyed their lunch together. After they had their lunch, they lay back in the grass and watched the clouds. Some clouds looked like animals or shapes. Bill spotted one that looked like a reindeer. Sarah pointed to one that looked like a drum. Finally Bill and Sarah got up and brushed off the grass and headed for home.	Bill and Sarah had Tuna fish and ham salad.

The dog barked, the other birds sang, the squirrel squeaked, and the rabbit clapped its ears together. The cat did not because his mouth was hot from some very strong mustard. He thought to himself that he wouldn't have eaten that hot dog if he knew it was on it. He tried to look for water, but that mustard drove his nose crazy and he couldn't smell anything. Not even water.   Luckily for the cat, cats have very good eyes, and he saw a puddle out of the corner of his eye. He ran to it. He wondered why the water was kind of yellow, and thought it must be from the leaves floating in the puddle. The cat took a big drink.

non_entailment	I stepped inside my mother's car and dropped my backpack on the floor as my face filled with excitement. Today's the day that we're going to the candy store and picking out a new treat to have after dinner. Some people may like going to the movies, or the game room, or even to parks, but going to the candy store once a week and getting to see all the different colors and taste all the different treats is my favorite activity. As soon as we pull up, she tells me to not run around too much inside, but I'm so excited I barely hear her. She opens the door and we walk inside where the clerk first welcomes us. Since we do this each week, he calls me by my name of Trevor and says that he's come up with a few candies for me to try.   I walk over to the table and see three types of M&M's laid out. He knows I'm not a big fan of peanuts so he left out the peanut kind, instead giving me mint flavored, cookies 'n creme flavored, and white chocolate flavored. They all taste great and the clerk asks which I like the most. It takes me a bit to choose, but I finally choose the Mint as this week's choice. He rings us up at the front desk and says that since we buy from his shop so much, he's going to give us a sale, so we think it'll be a nickel or a dime or even a quarter off. Actually, the clerk ends up cutting it half off! We thanked him and went on our way as I tried not to eat all the way home.	the clerk first doesdo upon Trevor and his mom entering the candy shop Calls Trevor by his name.

He knows I'm not a big fan of peanuts so he left out the peanut kind, instead giving me mint flavored, cookies 'n creme flavored, and white chocolate flavored. They all taste great and the clerk asks which I like the most. It takes me a bit to choose, but I finally choose the Mint as this week's choice. He rings us up at the front desk and says that since we buy from his shop so much, he's going to give us a sale, so we think it'll be a nickel or a dime or even a quarter off.

non_entailment	John wanted to have a birthday party for his son, Mike. John and his wife Sara knew that their son loved clowns, as did their daughter Jane. So they looked up a place to have a clown come to his birthday party. When the clown arrived, ten of Mikes friends showed up to watch the show. His parents had sent out 12 invites, thinking 6 or 8 kids would come. The clown started the show by squirting some water from a flower into John's face. This caused John's face to turn red. After the show, when everyone had left, it was up to John and Sara to clean up after the party. There was food everywhere; they had had salad and there was lettuce on the ground. Later that evening it was dinnertime and the family had to choose what to eat. The choices were order a pizza, make hamburgers, go get fried chicken or make noodles. Since it was Mike's birthday they let him choose. He really wanted pizza so they called up Pizza Palace to place their order. When the pizza arrived it did not come in a square box like most pizzas. Instead it was in a round box that no one had ever seen. John gave everybody a slice and then placed Mike in his lap to eat dinner.	6 of Mikes friends came to the party.

entailment	Once upon a time, there was a squirrel named Joey. Joey loved to go outside and play with his cousin Jimmy. Joey and Jimmy played silly games together, and were always laughing. One day, Joey and Jimmy went swimming together at their Aunt Julie's pond. Joey woke up early in the morning to eat some food before they left. He couldn't find anything to eat except for pie! Usually, Joey would eat cereal, fruit (a pear), or oatmeal for breakfast. After he ate, he and Jimmy went to the pond. On their way there they saw their friend Jack Rabbit. They dove into the water and swam for several hours. The sun was out, but the breeze was cold. Joey and Jimmy got out of the water and started walking home. Their fur was wet, and the breeze chilled them. When they got home, they dried off, and Jimmy put on his favorite purple shirt. Joey put on a blue shirt with red and green dots. The two squirrels ate some food that Joey's mom, Jasmine, made and went off to bed.	Joey ate for breakfast Pie.

Now he only saw his Grandfather in the summer.  Jake was really excited to show him his skills when he came to their next game.  He could throw really fast now.  He was sure his Grandfather would want to sit in the front to watch him.  He knew he would jump up and down.

non_entailment	There once was a little monkey who lived in a zoo. He was a tiny brown monkey, smaller than all of the others. He was quieter than the others too. He was so quiet, in fact, that his mommy monkey made him wear a small blue bell around his neck so that she could find him. Even when the little monkey was very quiet, whenever he moved, the bell would jingle and his mother could find him.  One day, this little monkey had been running around under the yellow sun for a long time, with his bell going "jingle jingle." He started to feel tired. But the other monkeys were still having fun and making a lot of noise. They were yelling and banging things together. The little monkey wanted to find somewhere quiet.  Finally, he knew what to do: he took off his blue bell. He hung it on a branch. Then he sneaked out of his cage in the zoo. He waited. He was very quiet and small. He waited until a young girl came walking through the zoo. She was with her mother and father. Then he jumped into her red backpack. He was so small that she didn't know he was there.

Finally, he knew what to do: he took off his blue bell. He hung it on a branch. Then he sneaked out of his cage in the zoo. He waited. He was very quiet and small. He waited until a young girl came walking through the zoo. She was with her mother and father. Then he jumped into her red backpack. He was so small that she didn't know he was there. The girl and her mother and father got in their car and went home.  When the girl got home, she set down her backpack. Her brother thought he saw her backpack moving. Her sister thought she heard something. But nobody knew that a tiny, sleepy monkey had come home from the zoo. He was happily sleeping in the girl's backpack in her quiet house, away from all the other noisy monkeys.	A mommy monkey was walking with the girl at the zoo.

non_entailment	Lucy is an eight year old girl who lives with her parents and pet bird. One Saturday afternoon, she sits at the kitchen table. She draws a picture of her family. She makes sure to draw her mom named Martha wearing a purple dress, because that is her favorite. She draws many yellow feathers for her pet bird named Andy. After she is done, she gives the picture to her mom. Her mom hangs it up on the silver refrigerator. The next day, Lucy's mom comes home with a brown dog named Oliver. She tells Lucy that she is pet-sitting, which is like babysitting but with a friend's dog. Lucy's mom tells her she can play with the dog as long as she takes good care of him. Lucy is excited. She pets Oliver nicely on his soft back. He wags his tail. He barks, "Woof!" and shows he wants to play fetch with her. Lucy giggles and throws a ball for him to catch. She wishes her bird could play like this with her every day!	Martha's favorite is color silver.
